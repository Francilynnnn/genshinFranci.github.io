				<h3 class="Heading">Personal Review and Comment on Kazuha</h3>
				<p class="Review">As soon as I got Kazuha in the game, my gaming experience is much more fun. I can say that he is also a very strong character because he buffs the team's elemental damage with Swirls and his elemental skill can group up enemies.The reason why I rate him as "SS" is because of his amazing skills that help the whole team to deal more damage using his skills and his burst.</p>
