			<p class="Description">The second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Xingqiu has had a reputation for being studious and polite ever since he was a young child. But there is another side to the mild-mannered Xingqiu everyone knows. A daring, adventurous and much more mischievous side.</p>

				<h3 class="Heading">Personal Review and Comment on Xingqiu</h3>
				<p class="Review">Xingqiu is one the best hydro and support character in Genshin Impact in my opinion. He is a good support  during fights especially that his elemental burst provides consistent Hydro application. The reason why I rate him as "SS" is because even though he is just a four-star character, he is overpowered and his elemental skill provides multiple elemental particle.</p>
