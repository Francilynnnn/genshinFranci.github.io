				<h3 class="Heading">Personal Review and Comment on Diluc</h3>
				<p class="Review">Diluc is one of my favorite characters that I use in playing Genshin Impact. In terms of fighting ice or cryo bosses, Diluc deals a lot of damage especially that his elemental burst has a large effect area. The reason why I rate him as "A" is because even though he is one of the good pyro characters in the game, his weakness is that he has low attack speed.</p>
